# Turtle Race Game

Welcome to the Turtle Race Game! This game allows multiple players to bet on a turtle and watch an exciting race to see which turtle crosses the finish line first. The game is implemented using Python's `turtle` module.

## How to Play

1. **Setup the Environment**: Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. This script uses the `turtle` module which comes pre-installed with Python.

2. **Run the Script**: Execute the script in your Python environment. 

3. **Input Number of Players**: When prompted, enter the number of players (up to 6).

4. **Place Bets**: Each player will then be asked to place their bet by choosing a turtle color. The available colors are:
   - Red
   - Orange
   - Blue
   - Yellow
   - Purple
   - Green

5. **Start the Race**: Watch the turtles race across the screen. The turtles will move randomly forward until one crosses the finish line.

6. **View Results**: The script will announce the winning turtle and check if any player's bet matches the winning color.

7. **Exit**: Click anywhere on the screen to exit the game.

## Script Overview

The script performs the following tasks:

- Sets up the race screen with a specified width and height.
- Prompts players to input the number of participants and their respective bets.
- Creates turtles with different colors and places them at the starting line.
- Moves the turtles randomly forward until one of them crosses the finish line.
- Announces the result of the race and determines if any player won based on their bet.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x (including the `turtle` module, which is part of the Python standard library)
- No additional libraries are required.

## Instructions

1. **Download the Script**: Save the script to a local directory on your machine.

2. **Run the Script**: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is saved. Run the script using the command:
